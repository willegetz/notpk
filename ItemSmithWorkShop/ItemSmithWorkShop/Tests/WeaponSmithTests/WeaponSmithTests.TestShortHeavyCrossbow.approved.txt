Weapon Text:
	You  draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch.
	Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes
	an attack of opportunity.
	Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands.
	However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one
	hand at a -4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow
	with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking
	with two one-handed weapons.
	This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.
