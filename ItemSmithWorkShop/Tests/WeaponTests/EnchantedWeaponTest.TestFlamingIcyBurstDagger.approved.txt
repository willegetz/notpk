Dagger: The dagger is a common secondary weapon. You get a +2 bonus on
	Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a dagger on your body.
Flaming: Upon command, a flaming weapon is sheathed in fire.
	The fire does not harm the wielder. The effect
	remains until another command is given.
Icy Burst: An icy burst weapon functions as a frost weapon that also
	explodes with frost upon striking a successful critical hit.
	The frost does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra
	damage from the frost ability, an icy burst weapon deals an
	extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a successful critical hit.
	If the weapon’s critical multiplier is ×3, add an extra 2d10
	points of cold damage instead, and if the multiplier is ×4,
	add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so
	crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition.
	Even if the frost ability is not active, the weapon still
	deals its extra cold damage on a successful critical hit.
