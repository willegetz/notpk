	The dagger is a common secondary weapon. You get a +2 bonus on
	Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a dagger on your body.

	This potent and feared ability allows the weapon to sever the heads of
	those it strikes. Upon a roll of natural 20 (followed by a successful
	roll to confirm the critical hit), the weapon severs the opponent's
	head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many
	aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems
	and undead creatures other than vampires, are not affected by the
	loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when their
	heads are cut off.
	A vorpal weapon must be a slashing weapon.
